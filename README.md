# Welcome Friends!
<p>To my github portfolio! Here I will showcase a few of the projects I have worked on. At current most of the projects showcased are Data Science and Analysis, mostly done in python. While python is currently my prefered language, I have also worked in Java, C++, and to a lesser extent Javascript. One of the main reasons I love Python is due to it's lightning fast development, and it's intense evolution of libraries. </p>

## Projects
<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/BoxOfficeMovies'><strong>Web Scraper</strong></a>
  <p>In this project I utilized several webscrapping libraries inorder to build an application to aggregate data across several affiliated websites which have a secure API and flex script. <br>
  Libraries: bs4, selenium, re, requests, pandas, numpy, lxml</p>
</div>

<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/HealthRiskAssessment'><strong>Prediction of Hypertension, Stroke and,  Diabetes</strong></a>
  <p>Multilabel machine learning assessment. Currently in phase of isolating different well performing models and weighting classes<br>
    Libraries: sklearn, scipy, pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib
  </p>

<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/FlaskRanking'><strong>Movie Queue Rest API</strong></a>
  <p>In this project I created a FLASK REST API so our discord group can login, add movies to a queue and vote on them so we can see which movie everyone is interested in. Features include an SQLite3 database of horror movies, flex layout, grid layout, search dropdown table selection, ordered view of movies in queue, HTMX for minimal code interactions.<br>
  Libraries: Flask, sqlite3, werkzeug, HTML, CSS, HTMX</p>

<div>
  <a href='https://www.github.com/CharlesPizza/'><strong>Movie Recommendation System</strong></a>
  <p>Here we create a recommendation system using a CSR Matrix and a KNNeighbors (Euclidean Distance) Algorthym. The recommendations are item based and segregated by genres. We've created only a small filesystem of images, so the interface reflects only this subsection, however it is ready to be easily converted to the entire movie library as all functions are the same. <br>
  Libraries: pyarrow, numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, </p>
</div>

<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/AudioAnalysisDollyParton'><strong>Audio Analysis of Dolly Parton Interview</strong></a>
  <p>Here we use AssemblyAI to perform audio analysis on small interview segments. We make a few notes on the sentiment analysis and frequency of words used. While the interviews are to small or short to form anything concrete, we are able to draw out a few simple patterns of speech and personal focus.<br>
  Libraries: pandas, hvplot, matplotlib, numpy, AssemblyAI</p>
</div>

<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/HeartFailure'><strong>Heart Failure Prediction</strong></a>
  <p>Here we do random forest modeling to predict death events following hospital admissions. Using exploritory data analysis we attempt to identify relevant features and disprove them. We do this with and without time components due to the problems inherit with time analysis and monitoring periods. <br>
    Libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib
